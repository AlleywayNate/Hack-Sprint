# File with heading

This code provides a basic structure for a MySpace-style homepage. It includes a header, navigation menu, main content area with left and right sidebars for profile information and friends list respectively, and a footer.

The CSS file (styles.css) styles the layout and provides basic styling for the elements.

The JavaScript file (script.js) generates random friends and posts when the page loads. You can expand on this by fetching data from an API or database to display real user information and posts.
